Project Gigapet JavaScript
Purpose: In this project you are going to create the functionality and UI for a simple Giga Pet
game. The purpose of this project is to make sure you have an understanding of JavaScript
arrays, objects, click events on an element, and how to change properties in elements.
Requirements: To complete this project you will add to the starter code provided. You may use
any editor that you prefer. For this project you will use the JQuery library. You may edit the
structure of the provided HTML and CSS to better fit your preferred style. You may use lecture
slides and the past hw’s for sample code but make sure to make it your own.
● Create a pet_info object with keys "name", "weight", "happiness" and set initial values.
Set this equal to variable "pet_info"
● Add a behavior to button interaction. When your pet receives a treat, add to its
happiness and weight. When your pet exercises, reduce its happiness and weight. When
your pet plays, add to its happiness and reduce its weight
● Fix key bugs to make sure certain key values can't go below zero. (can use conditional)
● Add a new action button
● Add a new behavior that correlates with the new button you added. You can add it below
the happiness text in the html
● Add a visual notification after each button press with a comment from your pet. For this
requirement you can not use console.log() or alert().
● Review jQuery documentation. Sign up for two unique methods (not discussed in class
and in starter code) and use it in your project. Provide comments fully explaining how the
methods are used.
What I will be grading on:
Implementation of all the Requirements. JavaScript, HTML and CSS have proper formatting and
comments where appropriate. Web page renders properly in Chrome. Make sure to change the
provided image to a new image of your choosing.
To get full points show creativity and a desire to excel above and beyond.
Some Examples:
● Add animations and/or sound effects to your pet when certain conditions occur.
● Use object constructors to create multiple pets.
● Refactor code to not use jQuery
● Any other ideas can be discussed in class/canvas/email.
Cheating: This project will be an individual project. You can discuss this project with other
students. You can explain what needs to be done and give suggestions on how to do it. You
cannot share source code. If two projects are submitted which show significant similarity in
source code then both students will receive an F for the project. Note a person who gives his
code to another student also fails the project (you are facilitating the dishonest actions of
another).
